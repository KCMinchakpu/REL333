                                    follow His teachings in the scriptures. Before the Fall, our Heavenly Father spoke directly to Adam and
                                    Eve. Thereafter, the <strong>Father introduced His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, as our Savior and Redeemer</strong> and gave
                                    us the command to <strong>“hear Him.” </strong> From this direction we conclude that the scriptural records of words spoken
                                    by “God” or the “Lord” are almost always the words of <strong> Jehovah, our risen Lord, Jesus Christ."</strong></p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>President Eyring's Life:</strong> President Nelson is an internationally renowned surgeon and medical researcher, Author of numerous publications, and as an accomplished Cardiovascular Surgeon, Dr. Nelson did not allow this position to hinder him from serving in the Lord's vineyard. He served faithfully for 31 years in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">He is the longest serving Apostle. As a father, President Nelson loves all his children, and as a husband, he also loves his wife and remained faithful to them. Another thing that impresses me about the Lord’s living Prophet is that his Professional Life endeared him to people globally, he was awarded honorary professorships from three universities in the People’s Republic of China and so many other awards in America an indication of his breakthrough in the field of vascular surgery.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One thing I also love about the President of the Church is that he uses his experience to teach us in the Church.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">President Nelson's Testimony</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As a President of the Church, <strong>President Russell M. Nelson</strong> has a great testimony about the Plan of Salvation. The president testified of the Abrahamic Covenants and the Blessings that comes to all those who key into the Abrahamic Covenant. He testified of Jesus Christ as the Jehovah of the Old Testament and how He promised Abraham that a Saviour would come through his lineage. The President testified also how the Abrahamic Covenant will last forever. And that the Abrahamic Covenant will be fulfilled in the Latter-day. The Prophet testified of the Restoration of the Priesthood, the gospel and the keys of the sealing power, and the temple works as the fulfilment of the Abrahamic Covenant. And that by preaching the restored gospel, many will come to believe that Jesus Christ is the “son of God”.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">President Nelson also testified that because of our faith, works and lineage which are revealed in our Patriarchal blessings, the blessings of the responsibility of the Priesthood are ours. Finally, President Nelson conclude his testimony by testifying that the ultimate blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant which are conferred in the Holy Temples which allows us to come forth in the first resurrection to inherit thrones, Kingdoms, Powers, Principalities and Dominions to our exaltation, glories in all things, and all these Abrahamic Covenant blessings are possible because of the Lord Jesus Christ, and because of Him we can live eternally with our families in the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
