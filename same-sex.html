           <p class="nephi">The following 10 quotes were gathered by me from the teaching of Prophets, 
            Seers, and Revelators for each topic. 1- 6 are from the current living prophets and apostles—with 
            no more than 2 quotes used from the same talk on the same topic. Quotes 7 – 10 are from other 
            prophets, apostles or speaker in an authorized setting—BYU-Idaho or BYU-Provo Devotional; Liahona, 
            Ensign or New Era Magazine; etc.—from this dispensation! Church leader quotes only!. Each quote 
            include a FULL reference of speaker, talk title, and date given. The References are on a line 
            by themselves. And each has its own reference.</p>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #1:</strong>"In recent years, many countries, including the United States, have legalized same-sex marriage. As members of the Church, we respect the laws of the land and abide by them, including civil marriage. The truth is, however, that in the beginning—in the beginning—marriage was ordained by God! And to this day it is defined by Him as being between a man and a woman. God has not changed His definition of marriage."</p>
                <P>President Russell M. Nelson, "The Love and Laws of God", September 2019 </P>
                <hr>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #2:</strong>"This is much bigger than just a question of whether or not society should be more tolerant of the homosexual lifestyle...The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints must take a stand on doctrine and principle. This is more than a social issue — ultimately it may be a test of our most basic religious freedoms to teach what we know our Father in Heaven wants us to teach."</p>
                <P>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “Same-Gender Attraction”, 2006</P>
                  <hr>
                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #3:</strong>"These things (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or same-sex attraction) are questions of resolution over time, and accommodation over time, and seeking the will of the Lord over time, and guided by Him over time. So, I hope we will give ourselves the time, and have the patience to listen and understand, and not insist on everything being resolved within a certain framework of time.”</p>
                <P>Elder D. Todd Christofferson, ““The Purpose of this Website (Same-sex attraction)” 2016.</P>
                <hr>
                
                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #4:</strong>“As a Church, nobody should be more loving and compassionate. … Let us be at the forefront in terms of expressing love, compassion, and outreach. Let’s not have families exclude or be disrespectful of those who choose a different lifestyle as a result of their feelings about their own gender."</p>
                <P>Elder Quentin L. Cook “Let Us Be at the Forefront", 2016.</P>
                <hr>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #5:</strong>"Of special concern to us should be those who struggle with same-sex attraction. It is a whirlwind of enormous velocity. I want to express my love and admiration for those who courageously confront this trial of faith and stay true to the commandments of God! But everyone, independent of his or her decisions and beliefs, deserves our kindness and consideration."</p>
                <P>Elder Neil L. Andersen, "Spiritual Whirlwinds", April 2014</P>
                <hr>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #6:</strong>"The same principles apply to those of you who are experiencing same-gender attraction and feel discouraged and helpless. And maybe for this reason some of you are feeling that the gospel of Jesus Christ is not for you anymore. If that is the case, I want to assure you that there is always hope in God the Father and in His plan of happiness, in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice, and in living Their loving commandments."</p>
                <P>Elder Ulisses Soares, "Take Up Our Cross", October 2019</P>
                <hr>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #7:</strong>"I know many who wrestle with wrenching matters of identity, gender, and sexuality. I weep for them, and I weep with them, knowing how significant the consequences of their decisions will be."</p>
                <P>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, "Lifted Up upon the Cross" October 2022</P>
                <hr>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #8:</strong>"There are those who would have us believe in the validity of what they choose to call same-sex marriage. Our hearts reach out to those who struggle with feelings of affinity for the same gender. We remember you before the Lord, we sympathize with you, we regard you as our brothers and our sisters. However, we cannot condone immoral practices on your part any more than we can condone immoral practices on the part of others."</p>
                <P>President Gordon B. Hinckley, "Stand Strong against the Wiles of the World", October 1995</P>
                <hr>

                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #9:</strong>"...do not ever let anybody touch your body in order to stimulate in any way those sacred powers of creation. Nobody! Not of your same gender or any gender! That power is to be expressed only and solely with your husband or wife to whom you are legally and lawfully married"</p>
                <P>President Boyd K. Parker, "The Instrument of Your Mind and the Foundation of Your Character" February 2003</P>
                <hr>
                
                <p class="helaman"><strong>Quote #10:</strong>"False prophets and false teachers are also those who attempt to change the God-given and scripturally based doctrines that protect the sanctity of marriage...They advocate a redefinition of morality to justify fornication, adultery, and homosexual relationships. Some openly champion the legalization of so-called same-gender marriages."</p>
                <P>Elder M. Russell Ballard, "Beware of False Prophets and False Teachers" October 1999</P>
