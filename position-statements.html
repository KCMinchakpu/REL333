            <p class="nephi">A position statement is a clear and concise declaration of an individual or group's 
                stance on a specific issue. It outlines the main argument and provides a brief overview of the 
                supporting points.

                Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of our testimonies. A testimony is a witness or confirmation of eternal truth impressed upon individual hearts and souls through the Holy Ghost. A testimony of Jesus Christ, born of and strengthened by the Spirit, changes lives—it changes the way we think and how we live. A testimony turns us toward our Heavenly Father and His divine Son.

                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">God is the Father of our spirits. We are created in His “image and likeness”, this means we have divine potentials. 
                    We have the ability to become like him. In an October 2020 General Conference talk titled “Let God Prevail”, President Russell M. Nelson 
                    taught that <strong> “Each of us has a divine potential because each is a child of God. Each is equal in His eyes. The implications of this truth 
                    are profound.”</strong> This statement always reminds me of who I am, and what I can do or achieve because of my divine potential. When I started 
                    BYU Pathway, and subsequently BYU Online degree with BYU Idaho, there were so many obstacles on my way that could discourage me. My 
                    family background, my educational background, my financial status, and the economic situation in my country. But anytime I remember 
                    President Nelson’s teaching, I see myself conquering all, because I belive that God is the Father of my spirit, and with His divine 
                    nature in me, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (Philippians 4:13). I know that I am a “chosen generation, 
                    a royal priesthood ... a peculiar [person]” called forth to show Gods excellency, and His divine nature has given me the opportunity 
                    to be “[partaker] of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). I know these to be true in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">As members of the Lord’s Church, we are covenant making and covenant keeping people. With today’s technology, 
                    we can quickly find detailed instructions and maps to help us get to wherever we want to go. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is 
                    our map and detailed instruction to find meaning in this life as well as eternal life in the world to come. When we choose to follow 
                    Christ and live the gospel, God offers us sacred covenants and ordinances of salvation and exaltation, which connect us to Him and 
                    direct us on the path leading to eternal life. Making and keeping sacred covenants binds us to the Lord Jesus Christ (Doctrine and Covenants 35:24). 
                    President Russell M. Nelson explained, “Entering into a covenant relationship with God binds us to Him in a way that makes everything about life easier. 
                    Please do not misunderstand me: I did not say that making covenants makes life easy. … But yoking yourself with the Savior means you have access to His 
                    strength and redeeming power.” Everything in the gospel of Jesus Christ is designed to prepare us to follow Him and become more like Him. Elder David A. Bednar stated, 
                    “Covenants and ordinances are the building blocks that enable us to build our lives upon the ‘rock of our Redeemer’ [Helaman 5:12] and His Atonement.” When we seek to
                    endure to the end by keeping our covenants, we will enjoy the salvation and redemption offered by Jesus Christ (Omni 1:26). Life has not been easy for me and my family lately. 
                    We find it hard to have three square meals a day. Sometime life becomes so tough that we feel God had forgotten us. But through the Covenants I made with the Lord, 
                    and binding myself to the Saviour makes life easier. I know that through the atonement of Jesus Christ, I can find my way home through walking in the Covenant path. This I know to be true, and I say so in the Name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">In an October 2020 General Conference talk titled “Let God Prevail”, President Russell M. Nelson ask some powerful questions that I use every day to monitor and guide my daily activities. President Nelson asked, “Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life?” I have come to realize that whenever I listen to the counsel of the living prophets and do the things they said, life gets better and easier. I remembered the Prophets, both ancient and modern, counselled us about debt. I was in desperate need of money, so I went and borrowed some money from someone. The money was 40, 000 Naira (about $35). I was not able to pay the loan back at the expected time. This turns out bad for me. At the end, I was forced to pay close to 250, 000 Naira ($245). It was then it dawned on me that I did not listen to the prophets’ counsel about entering debt. I know that if we listen to the prophets and do what they ask us to do, God will prevail in our lives and things will be better. This experience really taught me that the Prophets are the mouthpiece of God, and they speak the mind and the will of our Heavenly.</p>
