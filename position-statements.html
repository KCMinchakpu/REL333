            <p class="nephi">A position statement is a clear and concise declaration of an individual or group's 
                stance on a specific issue. It outlines the main argument and provides a brief overview of the 
                supporting points.

            <blockquote>
                Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of our testimonies. A testimony is a witness or confirmation of eternal truth impressed upon individual hearts and souls through the Holy Ghost. A testimony of Jesus Christ, born of and strengthened by the Spirit, changes lives—it changes the way we think and how we live. A testimony turns us toward our Heavenly Father and His divine Son.

                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">God is the Father of our spirits. We are created in His “image and likeness”, this means we have divine potentials. 
                    We have the ability to become like him. In an October 2020 General Conference talk titled “Let God Prevail”, President Russell M. Nelson 
                    taught that <strong> “Each of us has a divine potential because each is a child of God. Each is equal in His eyes. The implications of this truth 
                    are profound.”</strong> This statement always reminds me of who I am, and what I can do or achieve because of my divine potential. When I started 
                    BYU Pathway, and subsequently BYU Online degree with BYU Idaho, there were so many obstacles on my way that could discourage me. My 
                    family background, my educational background, my financial status, and the economic situation in my country. But anytime I remember 
                    President Nelson’s teaching, I see myself conquering all, because I belive that God is the Father of my spirit, and with His divine 
                    nature in me, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (Philippians 4:13). I know that I am a “chosen generation, 
                    a royal priesthood ... a peculiar [person]” called forth to show Gods excellency, and His divine nature has given me the opportunity 
                    to be “[partaker] of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). I know these to be true in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">As members of the Lord’s Church, we are covenant making and covenant keeping people. With today’s technology, 
                    we can quickly find detailed instructions and maps to help us get to wherever we want to go. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is 
                    our map and detailed instruction to find meaning in this life as well as eternal life in the world to come. When we choose to follow 
                    Christ and live the gospel, God offers us sacred covenants and ordinances of salvation and exaltation, which connect us to Him and 
                    direct us on the path leading to eternal life. Making and keeping sacred covenants binds us to the Lord Jesus Christ (Doctrine and Covenants 35:24). 
                    President Russell M. Nelson explained, “Entering into a covenant relationship with God binds us to Him in a way that makes everything about life easier. 
                    Please do not misunderstand me: I did not say that making covenants makes life easy. … But yoking yourself with the Savior means you have access to His 
                    strength and redeeming power.” Everything in the gospel of Jesus Christ is designed to prepare us to follow Him and become more like Him. Elder David A. Bednar stated, 
                    “Covenants and ordinances are the building blocks that enable us to build our lives upon the ‘rock of our Redeemer’ [Helaman 5:12] and His Atonement.” When we seek to
                    endure to the end by keeping our covenants, we will enjoy the salvation and redemption offered by Jesus Christ (Omni 1:26). Life has not been easy for me and my family lately. 
                    We find it hard to have three square meals a day. Sometime life becomes so tough that we feel God had forgotten us. But through the Covenants I made with the Lord, 
                    and binding myself to the Saviour makes life easier. I know that through the atonement of Jesus Christ, I can find my way home through walking in the Covenant path. This I know to be true, and I say so in the Name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">In an October 2020 General Conference talk titled “Let God Prevail”, President Russell M. Nelson ask some powerful questions that I use every day to 
                  monitor and guide my daily activities. President Nelson asked, “Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence 
                  in your life?” I have come to realize that whenever I listen to the counsel of the living prophets and do the things they said, life gets better and easier. I remembered the 
                  Prophets, both ancient and modern, counselled us about debt. I was in desperate need of money, so I went and borrowed some money from someone. The money was 40, 000 Naira (about $35). 
                  I was not able to pay the loan back at the expected time. This turns out bad for me. At the end, I was forced to pay close to 250, 000 Naira ($245). It was then it dawned on me that I 
                  did not listen to the prophets’ counsel about entering debt. I know that if we listen to the prophets and do what they ask us to do, God will prevail in our lives and things will be better. 
                  This experience really taught me that the Prophets are the mouthpiece of God, and they speak the mind and the will of our Heavenly.</p>

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">Truth, Jesus Christ said, “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8: 32). Elder Richard G. Scott asked, “Since truth is the only 
                  meaningful foundation upon which we can make wise decisions, how then can one establish what is really true?”. Lot of people in the world today are making lots of mistakes and taking decisions 
                  that will further lead them to destruction. The Lord wants us to teach these people and bring them to knowledge of the truth. In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared 
                  “Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come” (D&C 93:24). It is true that we have wandered far from God’s plan of Salvation, it is true that our Heavenly 
                  Father so “much love the world, that He gave His only begotten son” to redeem us from the fall. I know that I have the responsibility to teach others, especially my family members the truth in 
                  love and humility. Today, I am going to teach others the truth about the plan of salvation. And bring them to Lord.</p>

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">There is a popular saying in the Church, <strong>“You can’t live on borrowed light”</strong> . That expression has always encouraged me to seek a personal testimony. 
                  Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles say that we would need our own light to face the unexpected “jagged rocks and uneven cliffs” in our lives. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf 
                  of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pointed out “Let us acknowledge that most often gaining a testimony is not a task of a minute, an hour, or a day. It is not once and done. The process of 
                  gathering spiritual light is the quest of a lifetime.” This help me to know that I must do what President Nelson taught "take charge of your testimony and cause it to grow, you will become a 
                  more potent instrument in the hands of the Lord. You will be 'inspired by a better cause'—the cause of Jesus Christ!”.  I have made it a point of duty since I started this course to read every 
                  day a conference talk or listen to them on audio.</p>

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">President Nelson taught, "Marriage brings greater possibilities for happiness than does any other human relationship. Yet some married couples fall short of their full potential. 
                  They let their romance become rusty, take each other for granted, allow other interests or clouds of neglect to obscure the vision of what their marriage really could be. Marriages would be happier if 
                  nurtured more carefully." This is the topic I decided to write my application project. Reading the 10 quotes from the Living Prophets and the apostles opened my eyes to the importance of marriage and 
                  family to Heavenly Father's plan of Salvation. Families can be together forever if they are sealed in the temple and all strive to keep their marriage vows and walk in the covenant path. I have learned 
                  so about marriage from these great men of God. President Nelson taught "Marriage is sanctified when it is cherished and honored in holiness. That union is not merely between husband and wife; it embraces 
                  a partnership with God." Today, I have made up my mind to make my marriage and my family my priority. My love for my wife and my children has increased because of the teachings of these prophets and apostles.</p>

                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">Some members may feel same-sex attraction or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Feeling same-sex attraction or choosing to use a sexual identity label (such as gay, lesbian, or bisexual) is not a sin and does not violate Church policy. Elder Neil L. Andersen, Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught, "Of special concern to us should be those who struggle with same-sex attraction. It is a whirlwind of enormous velocity. I want to express my love and admiration for those who courageously confront this trial of faith and stay true to the commandments of God! But everyone, independent of his or her decisions and beliefs, deserves our kindness and consideration." I have always felt disgusted with people who identified themselves as "gay, lesbian, or bisexual", and more recently, the term "LGBT" brings disdain in my heart for those who associates themselves with such. Not until I read the teachings of Church leaders about these people struggling with same-sex attraction. Even though the Church leaders are not sanctioning people to cling unto such feelings, these people only need our "kindness and consideration". Today, I decided to help friends around me who might be struggling with such feelings. I made up my mind to love first, listen to understand, teach truth, nourish faith, and minister to these people knowing that they are battling with sensitive or trying situations.</p>

                <h4 class="ms-5">Personal Summary, Reflection or Position Statement</h4>
                <p class="nephi-2 ms-5 me-5">In an October 2017 General Conference, Elder Stanley G. Ellis, Emeritus Member of the Seventy give a talk titled "Do We Trust Him? Hard Is Good", taught "Our world today is difficult. We have rampant evil, corruption in every nation, terrorism reaching even safe places, economic collapse, unemployment, disease, natural disasters, civil wars, despotic leaders, and so on. What should we do? Do we flee or fight? Which is right?". To me running to God is the best solution. The Members of the Godhead are no strangers to suffering and hard things. God the Father sacrificed His Only Begotten Son to the terrible suffering of the Atonement, including death by crucifixion. The scriptures say Jesus Christ learned “obedience by the things which he suffered” (Hebrews 5:8). He voluntarily suffered the agony of the Atonement. The Holy Ghost must be long-suffering to prompt, warn, and guide us, only to sometimes be ignored, misinterpreted, or forgotten. I have come to understand and to believe that to survive this world that is out of control, I only need to look to God and live. The living Prophets and Apostles encourages us to put our trust in and God and to trust Him no matter our situation. From their teachings, I came to understand that our Heavenly Father will never forsake me. This is what I believe.</p>
